# 🏥 AI-Enabled Electronic Medical Record (EMR) System

An AI-powered web-based EMR system built to modernize hospital workflows, enhance patient experience, and streamline medical record management through smart automation.

## 📌 Project Overview

This system was inspired by a real incident where a team member attempted to book a hospital appointment online but never received a response. We identified a gap in how many hospitals manage online bookings, records, and patient communication—mostly using manual or disconnected systems.

We conducted field research by visiting local hospitals to observe real-world issues such as manual appointment scheduling, paper-based records, and lack of communication between departments. This led us to build a fully integrated solution with AI assistance and real-time data flow.
